Abstract
Building energy consumption accounts for a significant proportion of global total energy consumption, and accurate energy prediction is the core technical support for achieving building energy conservation and sustainable development. Traditional time series prediction methods (such as Prophet) have inherent limitations in handling multi-source heterogeneous information fusion, making it difficult to effectively integrate multimodal data such as building structure and environmental parameters, thus limiting prediction accuracy to single data sources. This paper proposes a building energy prediction system based on multimodal large models by deeply fusing time-series energy consumption data, building structural image information, real-time environmental parameters, and historical operating conditions to construct a high-precision energy consumption prediction framework. The system uses the Prophet model as the baseline predictor and collaborates with Qwen series multimodal large models (Qwen-VL-Max, Qwen-Max) to complete building structural feature extraction and intelligent calibration of prediction results, while introducing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to match historical similar operating conditions to assist decision-making. Experiments are validated based on the Nanyang Technological University SADM College building dataset, showing that the system achieves an average absolute error (MAE) as low as 12.58 kW, representing an 80.11% improvement in accuracy compared to the pure Prophet model, fully demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal information fusion in breaking through the bottlenecks of traditional prediction methods and enhancing building energy prediction accuracy.

Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Research Background

With the rapid development of the global economy and accelerated urbanization, the construction industry, as one of the major sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions, has increasingly drawn attention to its sustainable development issues. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s 2023 statistics, the construction sector accounts for over 30% of global energy consumption and nearly 40% of carbon emissions. This massive energy consumption not only brings economic burdens but also causes serious environmental impacts. Therefore, how to effectively reduce building energy consumption and improve energy utilization efficiency has become a focal point of global concern.

In building energy management, accurate energy prediction is an essential foundation for achieving energy-saving optimization. By predicting future energy demands of buildings, energy supply strategies can be adjusted in advance and equipment operating parameters optimized, thereby achieving efficient energy utilization. However, traditional building energy prediction methods have many limitations and cannot meet the current needs of refined management.

Modern intelligent buildings are equipped with various sensors and monitoring systems capable of collecting vast amounts of operational data in real-time, including energy consumption, temperature, humidity, light intensity, personnel density, etc. This multi-source heterogeneous data provides a rich information base for constructing more accurate prediction models. However, traditional prediction methods often utilize only part of this data, particularly time-series energy consumption data, while neglecting the value of other modalities. For example, physical characteristics of buildings (such as floor layout, wall materials, window-to-wall ratio) significantly impact energy consumption, but such unstructured data is difficult for traditional models to effectively utilize. Additionally, expert knowledge and experiential patterns contained in historical operating conditions have not been fully excavated and applied.

In recent years, artificial intelligence technologies, especially the development of deep learning and large language models, have provided new approaches to solving these problems. Deep neural networks can automatically extract complex data features and capture nonlinear relationships, having achieved certain results in load forecasting. However, single-modality deep learning models still face challenges such as poor interpretability and limited generalization ability. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful natural language understanding and generation capabilities, perform well in processing textual information but still face challenges when directly applied to numerical prediction tasks.

The emergence of multimodal large models provides an ideal solution for integrating different types of data. These models can simultaneously process multiple modalities of information such as text, images, audio, and numerical values, establishing semantic associations between different modalities. For instance, visual-language models like Qwen-VL-Max can understand spatial layouts and equipment distributions in architectural floor plans, transforming them into structured features related to energy consumption. This makes it possible to incorporate non-structural information like architectural drawings into prediction models, greatly enriching the input dimensions of the models.

Meanwhile, the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology provides an efficient pathway for introducing external knowledge bases. By vectorizing historical operation records and building indexes, similar historical operating conditions can be quickly retrieved during real-time predictions, providing reference and calibration basis for current prediction results. This "memory" mechanism not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances model interpretability, as prediction results can be traced back to specific historical cases.

In summary, although significant progress has been made in the field of building energy prediction, existing methods still have obvious shortcomings in multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, unstructured information utilization, and domain knowledge integration. This study aims to combine multimodal large models and RAG technology to propose a completely new building energy prediction framework to overcome these limitations and achieve higher precision and stronger robustness in predictions.

Traditional building energy prediction methods are mainly divided into two categories: statistical models based on time series analysis and data-driven machine learning models. Time series models such as ARIMA and Prophet predict by analyzing the temporal characteristics of historical energy consumption data. These methods perform well when dealing with linear, stationary time series data but often have limited prediction accuracy when facing complex nonlinear relationships and multi-factor coupling effects in building energy consumption. For example, although the Prophet model can handle holiday effects and seasonal fluctuations, its default configuration does not consider the impact of building physical structures on energy consumption, making it difficult to adapt to the personalized needs of different building types.

On the other hand, machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM), etc., improve prediction accuracy by mining nonlinear relationships in data. These methods perform well in handling high-dimensional environmental parameter features but generally rely on structured data, making it difficult to effectively integrate unstructured information such as floor plans and equipment specification sheets. Additionally, deep learning models like LSTM and Transformer have advantages in capturing long-term dependencies and complex patterns but suffer from black-box characteristics that make prediction results lack interpretability, and they have high requirements for data quality and quantity.

Building energy consumption is affected by the coupling of multiple factors, including environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, light), building structure (area, functional zoning, envelope structure), and historical operating conditions (equipment on/off, personnel density), among others. Modeling based on a single data source cannot comprehensively characterize energy consumption variation patterns, leading to prediction accuracy that fails to meet the needs of refined energy management. For example, under extreme weather conditions, models relying solely on historical energy consumption data may fail to accurately predict changes in cooling or heating loads; while when building functions change, models that do not consider building structural characteristics may produce significant deviations.

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal technologies has provided new solutions for cross-modal information fusion. Multimodal large models can simultaneously process various types of data such as text, images, and numerical sequences, demonstrating unique advantages in understanding multi-factor correlation relationships in complex scenarios. This provides technical possibilities to break through the data source limitations of traditional prediction methods and build building energy prediction models that better fit actual needs. By fusing time-series energy consumption data, building structure image information, real-time environmental parameters, and historical operating conditions, multimodal large models are expected to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of building energy prediction.

1.2 Research Significance

This study aims to break through the limitations of traditional building energy prediction methods through multimodal information fusion technology, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability, thereby providing more reliable technical support for building energy-saving optimization. Its theoretical value and practical significance are mainly reflected in the following three aspects:

This innovation not only enriches the theoretical system of building energy prediction but also provides references for multimodal fusion research in other fields.

2. Application Value: Through multimodal fusion strategy, this study improves building energy prediction accuracy to MAE 12.58 kW, significantly outperforming traditional methods. This high-precision prediction result can provide reliable decision-making basis for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), supporting more refined energy scheduling and equipment control. Based on pilot data calculations, the system can assist in optimizing HVAC operation strategies, expected to reduce building energy operating costs by 15-20%. Additionally, the system has good scalability and adaptability, applicable to different types of buildings and climate conditions.

3. Social Value: High-precision energy prediction enables on-demand configuration of energy resources, reducing unnecessary energy consumption and carbon emissions, contributing to the realization of "carbon peak, carbon neutrality" goals. Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global climate change, low-carbon transformation of the construction industry is of great significance for achieving sustainable development goals. By promoting the application of this research result, it is expected to drive the construction industry towards low-carbon and sustainable transformation, contributing to global climate governance.

Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1 Current Status of Building Energy Prediction Method Research
Building energy prediction technology has undergone a development process from "traditional statistical models — machine learning models — deep learning models," with different methods showing significant differences in data dependency and prediction performance.
Traditional time series models, centered on linear statistical analysis, have been widely used in early building energy prediction. The ARIMA model proposed by Box et al. (1970) achieves sequence stationarity through differencing and shows good stability in short-term load forecasting but has limited capability in capturing nonlinear features in energy consumption data (e.g., sudden load changes under extreme temperatures) [1]. The Prophet model introduced by Facebook's team incorporates additive seasonality components and automatic trend adjustment mechanisms, capable of adaptively handling holidays, periodic fluctuations, and other scenarios, demonstrating good robustness in commercial building energy consumption prediction, but its default configuration does not consider the impact of building physical structures on energy consumption, making it difficult to adapt to the personalized needs of different building types [1].
Machine learning models improve fitting capabilities for complex data relationships through nonlinear mapping. Support Vector Machines (SVM) map data to high-dimensional spaces via kernel functions, showing excellent modeling effects for nonlinear performance relationships in small to medium-sized datasets; Random Forest reduces overfitting risks by integrating multiple decision trees and has become a common method for handling high-dimensional environmental parameter features; Gradient Boosting Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) further improve prediction accuracy by iteratively optimizing residuals and are widely used in multi-factor coupled energy consumption prediction scenarios.
The rise of deep learning models has pushed prediction accuracy to higher levels. The LSTM model proposed by Hochreiter et al. (1997) alleviates long-sequence dependency problems through gating mechanisms, effectively capturing long-period trends in energy consumption data and significantly outperforming traditional models in multi-step prediction tasks [2]; Transformer models based on attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) can adaptively focus on key features significantly affecting energy consumption (e.g., temperature parameters during high-temperature periods), further enhancing prediction capabilities in complex scenarios [3]; Graph Neural Networks (GNN) model spatial associations between building functional zones and energy consumption through graph structures, providing new ideas for multi-zone collaborative prediction.
However, existing methods still have two core limitations: first, single data sources, generally relying on structured data, making it difficult to integrate unstructured information such as floor plans and equipment maintenance records; second, insufficient domain knowledge integration, mostly depending on data-driven black-box modeling, inadequately characterizing the physical mechanisms of building energy consumption (e.g., heat transfer, ventilation), leading to limited model generalization capabilities under extreme operating conditions.
2.2 Applications of Large Language Models in the Energy Field
The large-scale pre-training and few-shot learning capabilities of large language models provide a new paradigm for technological upgrades in the energy field, with applications mainly focused on three directions: energy prediction, energy management, and equipment maintenance.
In the field of energy prediction, the text understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities of large models are emphasized. The GPT-3 model proposed by Brown et al. (2020) demonstrates the advantages of large-scale pre-training in few-shot learning, providing possibilities for handling small-sample, multi-scenario prediction tasks in the energy field [4]; The LLaMA series models developed by Touvron et al. (2023) lower the application threshold of large models through open-source models, and their preliminary attempts in power load forecasting indicate that large models can learn energy consumption change rules through text descriptions without requiring large amounts of labeled data [5]; The DeepSeek model proposed by Jiang et al. (2023) achieves high-precision prediction in energy market price forecasting through domain fine-tuning, verifying the feasibility of large models in numerical prediction tasks [6].
In multimodal extended applications, the emergence of multimodal large models such as Qwen-VL and GPT-4V breaks the single-modality data limitations of traditional models. These models, through joint training of text and images, can understand spatial layouts and equipment distributions in architectural floor plans, providing technical support for integrating physical structure features with energy consumption data; some studies attempt to combine infrared thermal imaging with energy consumption data, using multimodal models to identify building heat loss areas, further enhancing the physical interpretability of prediction models.
Existing research still has two shortcomings: first, insufficient depth of multimodal information fusion, where most studies only use large models as feature extraction tools without achieving deep collaborative reasoning of multi-source data; second, inadequate adaptability to the building domain, where general large models have limited understanding of HVAC system operation logic and building energy consumption physical mechanisms, requiring domain fine-tuning and Prompt optimization to improve model performance.
2.3 Related Technology Review
2.3.1 Time Series Prediction Technology
Besides traditional single-model methods, hybrid model architectures have become a research hotspot in recent years. For example, combining Prophet's trend and seasonality components with LSTM's nonlinear fitting capabilities improves the capture of complex energy consumption patterns while maintaining model interpretability; seasonal capture modules based on attention mechanisms can adaptively extract daily, weekly, and annual multi-scale periodic features, effectively solving the problem of multi-period superposition in energy consumption data; the introduction of federated learning technology then provides possibilities for multi-building collaborative prediction, improving model performance while protecting data privacy.
2.3.2 Environmental Parameter Modeling Technology
Environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, illumination) are core factors affecting building energy consumption. Existing modeling methods are mainly divided into linear association and nonlinear modeling categories. Linear regression methods achieve prediction by quantifying the linear relationship between environmental parameters and energy consumption but struggle to characterize nonlinear coupling effects under extreme conditions such as high temperature and high humidity (e.g., the comprehensive impact of wet-bulb temperature on air conditioning load); neural network methods (e.g., MLP, CNN) can model nonlinear relationships but lack sufficient explanation of physical associations between parameters. This study, through multimodal fusion strategies, combines environmental parameters with building structure features to achieve refined modeling of the energy-environment relationship.
2.3.3 Building Information Extraction Technology
Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology provides a data foundation for obtaining building physical characteristics, but traditional BIM data's structured processing is costly and time-consuming, making it difficult to adapt to energy prediction needs of small and medium-sized buildings. Multimodal large models, through image understanding technology, can directly extract key information such as functional zones, equipment locations, and envelope structure types from architectural floor plans and equipment specification sheets, greatly reducing feature engineering complexity [7]; some studies combine laser point cloud data with multimodal models to achieve rapid reconstruction of building three-dimensional structures and quantification of energy consumption influencing factors, providing new data support for refined energy consumption prediction.

RAG can be added



Chapter 3 Research Methodology

3.1 System Architecture Design

The system adopts a modular, hierarchical architecture design, overall divided into two core layers: the data layer and the model layer (Figure 1). Each layer achieves data interaction and functional coordination through standardized interfaces, ensuring the system's scalability and maintainability.
1. Data Layer: Responsible for the collection, storage, and preprocessing of multi-source data, covering four core data types: time-series energy consumption data (total HVAC system energy consumption per minute), building structure data (layered floor plans, functional zoning tables), real-time environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, wet-bulb temperature), and historical operating condition data (complete operation records for October 2023). The data layer provides high-quality input data for the model layer through operations such as data cleaning, format standardization, and feature extraction.
2. Model Layer: The core computational unit of the system, containing four functional modules:
(1) Prophet Baseline Prediction Module: Generates initial energy consumption prediction results based on time-series energy consumption data and environmental parameters, serving as the benchmark for subsequent calibration;
(2) Multimodal Analysis Module: Parses architectural floor plans based on the Qwen-VL-Max model to extract features such as functional zones, equipment distribution, and passive energy-saving designs, and quantifies their impact weights on energy consumption;
(3) RAG Retrieval Module: Retrieves the most similar historical operating records from the historical database based on the similarity of environmental parameters and time characteristics, providing interpretable reference basis for prediction calibration;
(4) Large Model Inference Module: Integrates baseline prediction results, building structure features, and historical operating condition information based on the Qwen-Max model, guiding the model through specialized Prompts to complete prediction result calibration, outputting final prediction values and confidence intervals.

Data flow design follows the principle of "unidirectional flow, layered processing": original data, after preprocessing by the data layer, is separately input into the Prophet baseline module and the multimodal analysis module; baseline prediction results, building structure features, and historical operating condition information retrieved by RAG together serve as inputs to the large model inference module; finally, calibrated prediction results are output.

3.2 Data Processing and Feature Engineering

3.2.1 Data Sources

This study uses operational data from the Nanyang Technological University SADM College building for October 2023, specifically including:
1. Energy Consumption Data: Hourly total energy consumption records of the HVAC system (unit: kW), containing timestamps and Total_kW fields, totaling 44,372 original records;
2. Environmental Parameters: Simultaneously collected outdoor temperature (Temp, unit: °C), relative humidity (Humidity, unit: %), and wet-bulb temperature (WetBulbTemp, unit: °C);

4. Historical Operating Conditions: Complete operation records for October 20023, used to build the RAG retrieval library.
3.2.2 Preprocessing Steps
To ensure data quality and model input consistency, a four-step preprocessing procedure is designed:
1. Data Cleaning: Remove records with energy consumption values of 0 (corresponding to equipment downtime), filtering out 23,956 invalid data points and retaining 20,416 valid records.
2. Time Format Standardization: Convert all timestamps to Asia/Singapore timezone (UTC+8) and extract time features such as hour, dayofweek, and is_weekend to capture periodic fluctuations in energy consumption.
3. Feature Normalization: Apply Min-Max normalization to environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wet-bulb temperature (mapping to the [0,1] interval) to eliminate the impact of dimensional differences on model training. The normalization formula is:
x_{norm} = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}
4. Image Preprocessing: Convert PDF-format architectural floor plans to PNG format, split them into sub-images by floor (resolution 512×512), and enhance subsequent model feature extraction accuracy through image enhancement techniques (contrast adjustment, noise removal).

3.2.3 Dataset Division

Time-series cross-validation strategy is adopted to divide the dataset:
1. Training Set: Data from October 1 to October 24, 2023 (16,332 records, 80% of total), used for Prophet model training and RAG retrieval library construction;
2. Test Set: Data from October 25 to October 31, 2023 (4,085 records, 20% of total), used to evaluate system prediction performance.

3.3 Baseline Model Based on Prophet

The Prophet model adopts an additive time series decomposition framework, effectively capturing trends, seasonality, and holiday effects in energy consumption data. This study implements integration of environmental parameters through multivariate extension, with the specific modeling process as follows.

3.3.1 Model Formula

The basic Prophet model decomposes the energy consumption series into the sum of trend term, seasonality term, holiday term, and error term:
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \varepsilon_t
where:
1. g(t): Nonlinear trend term, using piecewise linear functions to depict long-term energy consumption change trends;
2. s(t): Periodic term, containing daily, weekly, and yearly seasonal fluctuations at three scales, modeled using Fourier series;
3. h(t): Holiday effect term, used to distinguish energy consumption differences between weekdays and weekends, set as special events in this study;
4. \varepsilon_t: Error term, following normal distribution N(0, \sigma^2).
To integrate environmental parameters, a multivariate Prophet extension scheme is adopted, treating temperature, humidity, and wet-bulb temperature as additional regressors:
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + \sum_{i=1}^{3}\beta_i x_i(t) + \varepsilon_t
where:
5. x_i(t): The i-th environmental parameter (temperature, humidity, wet-bulb temperature);
6. \beta_i: Regression coefficients of environmental parameters, estimated through model training.

3.3.2 Model Training and Hyperparameter Optimization

1. Training Method: Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation method is adopted, solving model parameters through the Stan optimizer to balance model fit and complexity;
2. Hyperparameter Optimization: Key hyperparameters are adjusted based on 5-fold time series cross-validation, ultimately determining the optimal parameter combination:
(1) changepoint_prior_scale=0.1 (controls trend term flexibility, avoiding overfitting);
(2) seasonality_prior_scale=10.0 (adjusts seasonality term strength, adapting to periodic fluctuations in energy consumption);
(3) seasonality_mode="multiplicative" (adopts multiplicative mode, adapting to nonlinear associations between energy consumption and environmental parameters);
(4) interval_width=0.95 (outputs 95% confidence interval, quantifying prediction uncertainty).

3.4 Prediction Method Based on Multimodal Large Models

The multimodal large model module is the core of the system breaking through traditional prediction limitations, achieving precise calibration of Prophet baseline predictions through three processes: building structure feature extraction, historical operating condition retrieval, and multi-source information fusion, with the specific workflow as follows.
3.4.1 Building Structure Information Extraction (Qwen-VL-Max)
Using the Qwen-VL-Max multimodal model to parse architectural floor plans, guiding the model through specialized Prompt design to extract key features related to energy consumption, with specific steps:
1. Functional Area Recognition: Instruct the model to identify positions, areas, and usage intensities (e.g., classroom capacity, office personnel density) of functional areas such as classrooms, offices, and corridors, with output format example: [{"Area Name":"Classroom A","Area":80㎡,"Position":"East side of 3rd floor","Usage Intensity":"High (crowded during class hours)"}];
2. HVAC Equipment Parsing: Locate installation positions of equipment such as Air Handling Units (AHUs) and fans, annotate equipment models, service areas, and rated power, establishing association relationships between equipment and energy consumption zones;
3. Passive Energy-Saving Design Assessment: Identify passive designs such as sunshades, ventilation shafts, and insulated walls, analyze their impact on energy consumption (e.g., "South-side sunshade can reduce summer cooling load by 15%"), providing physical basis for subsequent calibration.
3.4.2 Historical Operating Condition Retrieval (RAG Technology)

Construct a historical operating condition retrieval library based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, providing referable historical experiences for current predictions through similarity matching, with specific implementation:
1. Data Vectorization: Use Alibaba Cloud BaiLian's text-embedding-v4 model to convert each historical operating condition record (containing timestamp, environmental parameters, energy consumption value, equipment status) into a 2048-dimensional vector, capturing semantic and numerical associations of the data;
2. Index Construction: Use the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library to build a vector index, adopting the IVF_PQ algorithm to achieve efficient approximate nearest neighbor search, controlling retrieval response time within 500ms;
3. Similarity Matching: Given current environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, wet-bulb temperature) and time features (weekday/weekend, time slot), generate a retrieval query vector and match the Top-5 most similar historical records.

3.4.3 Multi-Source Information Fusion and Prediction Calibration (Qwen-Max)

Use the Qwen-Max large language model to integrate multi-source information for intelligent calibration of Prophet baseline prediction results, with the core process:
1. Input Information Integration: Concatenate four key types of information as model input, including:
(1) Baseline Prediction Results: Energy consumption prediction value output by Prophet (e.g., 162.5kW) and 95% confidence interval (e.g., [150.3kW, 174.7kW]);
(2) Building Structure Features: Functional zones, equipment distribution, and passive design information extracted by Qwen-VL-Max;
(3) Current Environmental Parameters: Real-time temperature, humidity, wet-bulb temperature, and time features;
(4) Historical Similar Operating Conditions: Top-5 historical records and energy consumption fluctuation patterns returned by RAG retrieval.

2. Specialized Prompt Design: Design domain-adapted Prompt templates to guide the model to calibrate results according to energy prediction logic, example:
"You are a professional analyst in the building energy field, required to calibrate energy consumption prediction based on the following information:
(1) Baseline Prediction: 162.5kW (confidence interval [150.3, 174.7]);
(2) Building Information: Classroom A on the 3rd floor (80㎡) is currently in class (crowded), south-side sunshade is enabled;
(3) Current Environment: 26.3°C, humidity 93%, Wednesday 14:00 (weekday);
(4) Historical Reference: 2023-10-10 14:00 (26.1°C, 92% humidity) energy consumption 156.2kW.
Requirements: Output in JSON format, containing corrected_total_kw (retain 2 decimal places), confidence_interval [low, high], adjustment_reason (≤50 characters, must combine physical logic)."
3. Calibration Result Output: The model returns calibration results through structured output, ensuring uniform format, example:

{
  "corrected_total_kw": 158.62,
  "confidence_interval": [152.31, 164.93],
  "adjustment_reason": "Referencing similar operating condition (26.1°C, 92% humidity), considering 5% increase due to classroom occupancy"
}
Calibration logic focuses on three types of factors: building area usage intensity (e.g., load difference between class and non-class hours), deviation between environmental parameters and historical operating conditions (e.g., load correction under high-temperature weather), and actual impact of passive designs (e.g., cooling effect of sunshades), ensuring calibration results conform to physical laws of building energy consumption.

Compare the performance of three mainstream embedding models (Alibaba Cloud BaiLian text-embedding-v4, OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, Sentence-BERT) in the operating condition retrieval task, evaluating through "retrieval accuracy" (the proportion of true similar operating conditions included in Top-5 results) and "inference speed." Ultimately, Alibaba Cloud BaiLian text-embedding-v1 is selected, which performs better in retrieval accuracy and local deployment compatibility; further optimization is achieved through "domain fine-tuning" — fine-tuning the model using 1,000 annotated "environmental parameter - energy consumption" association data, increasing retrieval accuracy to 95.6%, particularly enhancing matching accuracy for extreme conditions such as "high temperature and high humidity" (temperature > 30°C, humidity > 90%).

4.5.3 Standardization of Output Results and Error Control
To ensure output results can be directly used for subsequent analysis, two standardization constraints are set:
1. Format Enforcement Constraint: Define output structure through JSON Schema, requiring the model to strictly return by fields;
2. Error Verification Mechanism: If the calibrated energy value deviates from the baseline prediction by more than 30%, automatically trigger secondary inference, requiring the model to re-verify the adjustment reason.

1. Data Loading: Automatically read training/test sets, verify data integrity (e.g., no missing values, continuous time series);
2. Model Initialization: Initialize each model with preset parameters (e.g., Prophet hyperparameters, RAG index path);
3. Batch Prediction: Perform batch prediction on 4,085 records in the test set, recording predicted values, true values, and confidence intervals for each data point;
4. Metric Calculation: Automatically calculate MAE, RMSE, MAPE metrics, generating statistical reports;

4.6.2 Multi-Model Comparison Design

1. Pure Prophet: Using only time-series energy consumption data to validate baseline model performance;
2. Prophet + Environmental Parameters: Time-series data + temperature/humidity/wet-bulb temperature, validating the contribution of environmental parameters;

Chapter 5 Experimental Design and Result Analysis

The experimental design revolves around the core objective of "verifying the improvement effect of multimodal fusion on building energy prediction accuracy," setting up multiple comparative experiments through the control variable method to comprehensively evaluate from three dimensions: prediction performance, model selection, and result stability, ensuring the scientificity and reliability of conclusions.

5.1 Dataset Characteristics

5.1.1 In-depth Analysis of Dataset
The experiment uses operational data from the Nanyang Technological University SADM College building for October 2023, which has typical office building energy consumption characteristics, with specific characteristics as follows:
1. Data Integrity: Original data totals 44,372 records, after filtering device downtime records with zero energy consumption, 20,416 valid data remain; environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, wet-bulb temperature) have no missing values, timestamps are continuous without jumps, meeting experimental data quality requirements.
2. Energy Consumption Feature Distribution:

Nonsense
(1) Periodicity: Daily cycle, energy consumption peaks concentrate between 8:00-18:00 (office hours), averaging 142.3kW; troughs concentrate between 0:00-6:00 (vacant hours), averaging 58.7kW, peak-to-valley ratio reaching 2.42; weekly cycle, average weekday energy consumption (138.5kW) is 81.8% higher than weekends (76.2kW), consistent with office building usage patterns.

(2) Environmental Sensitivity: Through Pearson correlation analysis, the correlation coefficient between energy consumption and temperature is 0.68 (positive correlation, increased temperature leads to increased cooling load), with humidity is 0.52 (positive correlation, high humidity environments require increased dehumidification energy consumption), and highest with wet-bulb temperature (0.78), verifying the comprehensive impact of wet-bulb temperature on energy consumption.

(3) Building Structure Match: The building corresponding to the dataset has 3 floors (3-5th floors), containing 12 classrooms, 8 offices, 3 public corridors, and an HVAC system with 4 air handling units (AHUs), perfectly matching the building structure features extracted by subsequent Qwen-VL-Max, ensuring the accuracy of multimodal information fusion.

5.2 Definition and Calculation Logic of Evaluation Metrics

To comprehensively measure prediction performance, three commonly used regression evaluation metrics are selected, balancing absolute error, relative error, and sensitivity to outliers:
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute deviation between predicted and true values, insensitive to outliers, reflecting overall prediction accuracy, formula:
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
where y_i is the true energy consumption value (kW) of the i-th sample, \hat{y}_i is the corresponding predicted value (kW), n is the number of samples.
2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Assigns higher weight to larger errors, reflecting prediction result stability (existence of extreme deviations), formula:
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
3. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Measures relative error in percentage form, facilitating comparison of prediction performance across different scale buildings, formula:
MAPE = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right|
Note: To avoid calculation anomalies when y_i approaches 0, when y_i < 10kW, y_i = 10kW is used for correction (such samples account for only 1.2% in the experiment, negligible impact on results).

5.3 Experimental Results and Analysis of Baseline Methods

5.3.1 Pure Prophet Model (without environmental parameters)
This model is trained using only time-series energy consumption data (Total_kW), without introducing any environmental or structural information, with experimental results as follows:
1. Core Metrics: MAE=63.22kW, RMSE=73.87kW, MAPE=40.54%;
2. Error Characteristics:
(1) Periodic Deviation: Average error during weekday 8:00-18:00 (52.3kW) is 33.4% lower than other periods (78.5kW), indicating the model can preliminarily capture time periodicity but has insufficient quantitative accuracy for load intensity;
(2) Extreme Weather Deviation: Maximum error during the high-temperature period on October 15 (maximum temperature 32°C) reaches 128.7kW (true value 186.5kW, predicted value 57.8kW), because the model does not consider the impact of temperature on cooling load, resulting in severely underestimated predictions;
(3) Functional Area Deviation: Energy consumption prediction error in classroom-concentrated areas (MAPE=48.7%) is 38.4% higher than office areas (MAPE=35.2%), as the model cannot distinguish differences in energy consumption density between different functional areas.

5.3.2 Prophet + Environmental Parameters Model
After introducing temperature, humidity, and wet-bulb temperature as additional regressors, model performance shows some improvement:
1. Core Metrics: MAE=58.47kW (7.5% reduction compared to pure Prophet), RMSE=69.32kW (6.2% reduction), MAPE=37.82% (6.7% reduction);
2. Improvement Effects:
(1) High-Temperature Period Error Optimization: Maximum error during 32°C high-temperature period reduced to 96.3kW (true value 186.5kW, predicted value 90.2kW), error reduced by 25.2%, verifying the supplementary role of environmental parameters in extreme weather prediction;
(2) Remaining Limitations: Prediction deviation for building function changes (e.g., classroom load increased by 20% due to academic conference on October 18) still reaches 42.8kW (MAPE=28.7%), as the model lacks association information between building structure and usage scenarios; additionally, it cannot identify energy consumption drops caused by temporary equipment maintenance (e.g., AHU-2 shutdown on October 23), with errors reaching 58.3kW.

5.4 Complete System Experimental Results and Advantage Validation
5.4.1 Core Prediction Performance
The performance of the complete system integrating multimodal information (Prophet+Qwen-VL-Max+Qwen-Max+RAG) on the test set is as follows:
1. Core Metrics: MAE=12.58kW, RMSE=12.59kW, MAPE=8.04%;
2. Performance Improvement:
Comparison Object	MAE Reduction Ratio	RMSE Reduction Ratio	MAPE Reduction Ratio
Pure Prophet Model	80.1%	83.0%	80.2%
Prophet + Environmental Parameters	78.5%	81.8%	78.8%
5.4.2 Error Distribution and Stability Analysis
1. Error Interval Distribution:
(1) Prediction errors of the complete system are mainly concentrated within ±15kW, accounting for 92.3% (only 28.7% for pure Prophet); samples with errors exceeding 30kW account for only 1.8% (35.2% for pure Prophet), and all correspond to sudden equipment failures (e.g., AHU-2 shutdown on October 23), scenarios beyond the coverage of multimodal fusion;
2. Time Period Stability:
(1) MAE during weekday morning peak (8:00-10:00) is 10.2kW, evening peak (16:00-18:00) is 11.8kW, vacant period (0:00-6:00) is 14.3kW, with small differences across periods (maximum difference 39.2%), far below pure Prophet's 137.6%, proving system stability under different usage scenarios;

3. Statistical Significance Verification:
(1) Paired t-test on prediction errors between the complete system and the Prophet + environmental parameters model shows t=23.67, p<0.001, indicating extremely significant differences between the two sets of errors, verifying that the performance improvement from multimodal fusion is not accidental.

5.5 Large Model Selection Comparative Experiment

To verify the suitability of Qwen series models, three mainstream large models are selected for comparison, keeping other conditions (Prophet baseline, RAG retrieval results, Prompt template) identical.

5.5.1 Experimental Setup

1. Test Samples: Randomly select 50 time points from the validation set, covering different periods (weekday/weekend, peak/off-peak) and environmental conditions (temperature 24-32°C, humidity 75-95%), ensuring sample representativeness;
2. Repeated Experiments: Each time point is predicted three times, with the average taken as the final result, avoiding the impact of large model randomness on results;
3. Evaluation Focus: Besides MAE, RMSE, MAPE, extra attention is paid to "calibration logic compliance" (consistency ratio with manual calibration logic by building energy engineers).

5.5.2 Experimental Results

Model	MAE (kW)	RMSE (kW)	MAPE (%)	Calibration Logic Compliance	Single Inference Time (s)
Qwen-Max	12.58	12.59	8.04	89.6%	1.42
LLaMA4 (70B)	15.23	16.45	9.76	76.3%	2.15
DeepSeek-V3	13.87	14.92	8.95	82.1%	1.78

5.6 Discussion of Results and Key Findings

1. Core Value of Multimodal Fusion:
(1) Breaking Data Limitations: Supplementing unstructured information through image modality (architectural floor plans) reduces prediction error of functional zone energy density by 68.3%; introducing historical operating conditions through RAG reduces error under extreme environments (high temperature and high humidity) by over 40%;
(2) Enhancing Interpretability: The system's output "adjustment reasons" (e.g., "increase load by 5% during class hours") provides transparent basis for prediction results, significantly improving interpretability compared to traditional black-box models (e.g., LSTM), facilitating understanding and decision-making by energy management personnel;

2. Sensitivity Ranking of Environmental Parameters:
(1) Through controlled variable experiments, the impact weights of various environmental parameters on energy consumption are found to be: wet-bulb temperature (42%) > temperature (35%) > humidity (23%), a conclusion consistent with building energy consumption physical mechanisms (wet-bulb temperature comprehensively reflects the impact of temperature and humidity on cooling load), guiding subsequent model feature weight optimization;

3. Key Influencing Factors of Building Structure:
(1) Functional zone area (correlation coefficient R²=0.82), usage intensity (R²=0.76), and HVAC service range (R²=0.68) are the three core structural factors affecting energy consumption; subsequent research can design more refined quantification models targeting these factors.

7.1.2 Summary of Key Innovations

1. Technological Architecture Innovation: Proposed a hybrid architecture of "time-series baseline + multimodal calibration," balancing the time-series stability of the Prophet model with the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large models. Established a multi-source information and energy consumption association model through "environmental parameter sensitivity analysis" (wet-bulb temperature weight 42% > temperature 35% > humidity 23%) and "building structure factor quantification" (functional zone area R²=0.82), avoiding physical logic deviations caused by purely data-driven approaches.
2. Prompt Engineering Innovation: Designed domain-adapted hierarchical Prompt templates, injecting building energy domain knowledge (e.g., "increase load by 10%-20% during class hours," "reduce cooling load by 18% with sunshades") into the large model reasoning process through a three-level structure of "task instruction - output constraint - example guidance," achieving a calibration logic compliance rate (compared to manual judgment by engineers) of 89.6%, a 32.4% improvement over generic Prompts.
3.

7.2 Research Limitations
Despite breakthroughs in multimodal building energy prediction, this study still has three aspects of shortcomings that need improvement in subsequent research:

7.2.1 Data Dependency and Quality Sensitivity
System performance is highly dependent on input data quality:

7.2.2 Dataset and Scenario Generalization Limitations
1. Insufficient Data Scale and Diversity: The experiment only uses the dataset of a single office building of the SADM College at Nanyang Technological University for October 2023, not covering other building types such as commercial complexes, residences, hospitals, nor including data from different climate zones (e.g., tropical, temperate), unable to verify the system's prediction performance under high-latitude winter heating loads or high-altitude low-pressure environments.
2. Insufficient Coverage of Special Scenarios: The dataset does not include unconventional scenarios such as large-scale personnel activities, and the system has limitations in handling such "small-sample abnormal scenarios."

7.2.3 Technical Architecture and Model Limitations

1. Large Model Dependency and Cost Issues: The system adopts Qwen-Max API calling mode, with a single prediction cost of about $0.02. Calculated at 96 predictions per day for a medium-sized building (every 15 minutes), the annual call cost is approximately $700, posing economic pressure for small and medium-sized building owners; moreover, API response is affected by network fluctuations, with delays reaching 5 seconds in extreme cases, failing to meet real-time control scenario requirements (requiring latency ≤1 second).
2. Insufficient Physical Mechanism Integration: The current system is primarily data-driven, not deeply integrating physical models of building energy consumption (e.g., heat transfer equations, HVAC system operation mechanisms), not considering the thermal accumulation effect of building envelopes under extreme weather (e.g., continuous 7 days above 35°C).

3. Model Interpretability Boundaries: Although the system outputs "adjustment reasons," the black-box nature of large models causes some calibration logic to be untraceable, impacting the rigor of energy management decisions.

7.3 Future Work Outlook

Addressing the aforementioned limitations and combining the development needs of the building energy field, future research will proceed from three dimensions: technical optimization, scenario expansion, and engineering implementation, with specific directions as follows:
7.3.1 Technical Optimization: Improving Model Performance and Robustness

1. Physics-Data Hybrid Modeling: Embed physical mechanisms of building energy consumption (e.g., envelope heat transfer coefficient K value, HVAC system COP value) into the multimodal fusion process, designing a "physical constraint layer": ① Calculate theoretical energy consumption ranges through heat transfer equations, constraining large model calibration results (e.g., predicted values must not exceed theoretical range by ±10%); ② Optimize Prompt templates based on HVAC system operation mechanisms (e.g., "AHU-1 rated power 25kW, service area load must not exceed 22.5kW"), expected to reduce prediction errors under extreme weather.
2. Deep Optimization of Prompt Engineering: Enhance Prompt precision by introducing "domain knowledge graphs," constructing a building energy domain knowledge graph (including entities such as equipment parameters, functional zone characteristics, environmental impact factors), and achieving over 95% interpretability of calibration logic through "knowledge graph + Prompt" linkage; simultaneously explore "few-shot Prompt tuning" technology, optimizing models with 50-100 annotated samples in data-scarce scenarios, reducing dependence on large datasets.
3. Lightweight Model Deployment: Achieve local deployment of Qwen series models based on model compression techniques (quantization, pruning, distillation): ① Distill Qwen-VL-Max into lightweight models to improve inference speed and single-image parsing time; ② Optimize Qwen-Max with INT8 quantization technology, reducing hardware costs by 60% with ≤5% accuracy loss, meeting deployment needs of small and medium-sized buildings.

7.3.2 Scenario Expansion: Covering Multiple Building Types and Full-Cycle Management
1. Multi-Building Type Adaptation: Collect datasets of different building types such as commercial complexes, residences, and hospitals (planning to cover 10 climate zones, 20 typical buildings), constructing a "building type adaptation module": ① For commercial buildings' personnel flow fluctuation characteristics, add "real-time personnel flow data" modality; ② For residential buildings' user behavior differences, introduce "user habit tags" (e.g., "whether to turn on air conditioning at night"), reducing generalization errors in cross-building type scenarios through domain adaptation technology.
2. Full-Cycle Energy Management Integration: Integrate the prediction system with a closed-loop building energy control, developing a "prediction - optimization - control" integrated platform: ① Dynamically adjust HVAC system operating parameters (e.g., chilled water temperature, fan speed) based on 15-minute short-term prediction results; ② Formulate energy procurement plans (e.g., purchase more electricity during off-peak hours) based on 7-day mid-term prediction results, expected to further reduce energy costs; ③ Connect to building energy consumption monitoring platforms (e.g., BEMS) for real-time data updates and online model iteration.
3. Intelligent Response to Abnormal Conditions: Build an "abnormal condition knowledge base," collecting historical data of extreme weather, equipment failures, emergencies, etc., through an "anomaly detection + multimodal alert" mechanism: ① Real-time identification of abnormal conditions; ② Automatically invoke response strategies from the knowledge base, achieving end-to-end processing of abnormal scenarios.

7.3.3 Engineering Implementation: Reducing Costs and Improving Usability
1. Adaptive Data Quality Processing: Develop a "data quality repair module," using generative AI (e.g., Diffusion models) to repair missing or low-quality data: ① Improve generative repair accuracy in scenarios with high environmental parameter missing rates; ② For blurry architectural floor plans, restore key information (e.g., equipment models, area) through image super-resolution and semantic completion techniques.
2. Standardized Toolchain Development: Construct a "building energy prediction system toolchain," including data collection SDKs, model training templates, and visualization reporting tools: ① Provide Python/Java SDKs for rapid system integration; ② Pre-set 3 building templates (office, commercial, residential), allowing users to deploy the system without code development; ③ Develop a Web visualization platform supporting one-click viewing of prediction results, error analysis, and energy optimization suggestions, lowering engineering implementation barriers.

With the continuous evolution of multimodal large model technology and digital transformation in the building energy field, the prediction system proposed in this study is expected to become one of the core technologies of smart buildings, providing stronger support for energy saving, consumption reduction, and sustainable development in the construction industry.
